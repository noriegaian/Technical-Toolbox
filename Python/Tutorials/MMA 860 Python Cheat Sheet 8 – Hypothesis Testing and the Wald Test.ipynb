    "Hypothesis testing is one of the most common applications in statistical analysis.  We construct hypotheses in attempt to provide evidence in order to justify an action or change a belief.  We do this by forming an opinion we are prepared to believe in the absence of data and attempt to find evidence that would support changing that opinion.  \n",
